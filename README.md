## Summary
A full-stack, RESTful API, built using Node.js, serving a React front-end, styled with Bootstrap 4.  Quite a challenging application to build, and it turned out to have more features than I initially intended.

By crafting robust, and secure endpoints, I've honed my Node.js skills, and solidifed my knowledge of the Web API paradigm.  

With the use of class-based stateful components, and reusable functional components, the code is clean, and easy to interpet.
